# Measurement of Isotopic Ratios in the Stratosphere

This project is to determine whether, if at all, ratios between lines in limb emission spectra collected from the MIPAS instrument can serve as estimators for the relative abundance of heavy and light isotopes of gases in the stratosphere.

## Directory

Code for reading and processing MIPAS data is in the main directory.

Code for the simulations from the RFM (Reference Forward Model) are found in the rfm folder.
